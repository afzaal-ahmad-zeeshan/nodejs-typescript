# Express.js with TypeScript

This repository is a sample/test repository for creating APIs using Express.js
(TypeScript language) with an in-memory database. This repository is licensed
under MIT.

## How to use

> The steps mentioned below assume you have run `npm install` already.

To run the API, you can use:

``` bash
npm run serve
```

This should run the app on your [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

You can build the production instance and launch the web application using:

``` bash
npm run app
```

This should build the frontend, transpile the TypeScript and launch the UI for
the application.

## Postman

The API supports documentation in-code, with OpenAPI/Swagger, and a collection
on Postman. The resources are shared inside the code base, please see.
